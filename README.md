## Usage

- **For Creators**: Use the **Creator Dashboard** to manage your content, track donations, and interact with your audience in real-time.
- **For Server Owners**: Integrate the **BlinkShare Bot** into your Discord server to share Blink URLs and accept donations directly within the server.
- **For Supporters**: Support creators by donating Solana to their Blink URLs and interacting with real-time updates on the platform.

## Backend Logic

### Supabase
- **Authentication**: Manages user sessions, registration, and login.
- **Real-Time Data**: Tracks Blinks (content URLs) and donations in real-time. As a result, when a new donation is made, it triggers an immediate update to all users currently connected.
- **Database**: Stores user profiles, Blinks, donation history, and other related content.

### Solana Blockchain and Dialect Blinks
- **Solana Donations**: When users make a donation, it is processed through the Solana blockchain for instant, secure, and low-cost transactions.
- **Dialect Blinks Integration**: A simple donation system that allows creators to receive funds directly into their wallet with a seamless user experience.

### Real-Time Interaction
- **Supabase** powers real-time notifications, so as soon as a user donates or interacts with a Blink URL, all connected clients (Discord, web app) are updated instantly.
- The backend listens for changes in donations or Blink URLs, and the frontend (both Discord bot and the web app) updates the users in real-time without needing to refresh the page.
